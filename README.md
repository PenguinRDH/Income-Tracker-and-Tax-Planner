## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone Income-Tracker-and-Tax-Planner
cd income-tracker-and-tax-planner
```

### 2. Start Docker Desktop

Make sure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding.

### 3. Build and Run the Application

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the frontend, backend, and database containers
- Start all services
- Create the PostgreSQL database and tables automatically

### 4. Access the Application

Once all containers are running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

## Development

### Viewing Logs

To view logs for a specific service:

```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Frontend logs
docker-compose logs frontend

# Database logs
docker-compose logs db

# All logs
docker-compose logs
```

### Stopping the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Stopping and Removing All Data

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

⚠️ **Warning**: The `-v` flag removes all database data permanently.

### Rebuilding After Changes

If you make changes to the code:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

## Database Access

To connect to the PostgreSQL database directly:

```bash
docker-compose exec db psql -U user -d taxtracker
```

**Database Credentials**:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `taxtracker`
- User: `user`
- Password: `password`

You can also use GUI tools like pgAdmin or DBeaver with these credentials.

## Tax Calculation Details

The application uses 2026 federal tax brackets for single filers:

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Income visualization charts

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop Not Running
If you see `open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified`:
- Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully initialize
- Try the command again

### Port Already in Use
If ports 3000, 5000, or 5432 are already in use:
- Stop other applications using those ports
- Or modify the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`

### CORS Errors
If you see CORS errors in the browser console:
- Make sure the backend container is running
- Check that `flask-cors` is installed (it should be in requirements.txt)
- Rebuild the backend: `docker-compose up --build backend`
